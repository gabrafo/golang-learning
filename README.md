# Golang Learning

A personal repository for learning and practicing Go (Golang).

## Learning Resources

I am using the following resources to improve my understanding of the language:

- Official Go documentation and guides
- Online articles and discussions
- Stack Overflow (preferred for troubleshooting)
- LLMs for quick questions
- YouTube tutorials

## Goals

1. Learn the basics of the language
2. Explore backend web development (native or with frameworks like Gin)
3. Consider other use cases (such as game development)
